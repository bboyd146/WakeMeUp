# Wake Me Up!


## Description
This application is designed to allow a user to input a specific time that they want to wake up on any desired day.  I can stop the alarm and the application shows what song is playing. When the alarm goes off using either a known SoundCloud account, or SoundCloud itself, the user is prompted to turn off the alarm with no snooze button. The application will show the current time and weather forecast for the day so that the user can be aware of how the day will go.

- Our motivation for the project was to use what we learned from class, and bring it all together in this project.
- We built this project because we already knew what we needed and already had an idea of how to build it. We also wanted to make something left lane. 
- It solves a problem for heavy sleepers. To wake them up, with brutally loud music. 
- We learned how to work with people we do not really know, and with enough time we can get anything done. 

## User Story
As a heavy sleeper, I want to be able to set an alarm that plays random music each time that will surely wake me up in the morning. So that the user can get up in time to start the day and be greeted with real time weather.
